## 📊 How It Works

### Analysis Flow:

```
614 Stocks
    ↓
Quality Analysis (15 metrics)
    ↓
Consensus Building (4 perspectives)
    ↓  
87 Consensus Picks (2+ agreement)
    ↓
ML Predictions
    ↓
AI Pick Validation (validates all)
    ↓
🔍 AI CATALYST ANALYSIS (NEW - STEP 6.75)
    ↓
Focuses on TOP 10 stocks:
  Priority: 4/4 agreement first
  Then: 3/4 agreement
  Sorted by: Quality Score
    ↓
For EACH stock, AI searches for:
  • Recent news & earnings
  • Growth catalysts
  • Specific risks
  • Sentiment
  • Earnings outlook
    ↓
Catalyst Score 0-100 assigned
    ↓
Data merged into picks
    ↓
AI Top Picks Selection (uses catalyst data)
    ↓
📈 FINAL TOP 10 with Complete Intelligence
```

### Why Top 10 Focus?

**Strategic Decision for Maximum Accuracy:**
1. **API Efficiency**: Deep analysis requires detailed Grok queries (1500 tokens each)
2. **Focus on Best**: Top 10 = highest conviction picks (4/4 and 3/4 agreement)
3. **Quality over Quantity**: Better to deeply analyze best picks than superficially analyze all
4. **Risk Reduction**: Concentrated intelligence on most promising opportunities
5. **Accuracy Boost**: Detailed catalyst analysis improves prediction power
