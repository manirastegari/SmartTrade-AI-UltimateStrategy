# ✅ Streamlit App Updated - Fixed!

## 🔧 Issue You Reported

When running Ultimate Strategy in Streamlit, it showed:
```
Running Strategy 1: Institutional Consensus (300 stocks)...
```

**Problems:**
1. ❌ Only 300 stocks (should be 779)
2. ❌ Using OLD strategy (different stocks per strategy)
3. ❌ Not using optimized TFSA/Questrade universe

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Updated to Improved Strategy**
```python
# Before (OLD):
from ultimate_strategy_analyzer import UltimateStrategyAnalyzer
ultimate_analyzer = UltimateStrategyAnalyzer(analyzer)

# After (IMPROVED):
from ultimate_strategy_analyzer_improved import ImprovedUltimateStrategyAnalyzer
ultimate_analyzer = ImprovedUltimateStrategyAnalyzer(analyzer)
```

### 2. **Added Optimized Universe**
```python
# Added:
from tfsa_questrade_750_universe import get_full_universe
analyzer.stock_universe = get_full_universe()  # 779 stocks
```

### 3. **Updated Description**
```
Before:
1. Institutional Consensus (716 stocks)
2. Hedge Fund Alpha (500 stocks)
3. Quant Value Hunter (600 stocks)
4. Risk-Managed Core (400 stocks)

After:
All 4 strategies analyze THE SAME 779 stocks:
1. Institutional Consensus (stability focus)
2. Hedge Fund Alpha (momentum focus)
3. Quant Value Hunter (value focus)
4. Risk-Managed Core (safety focus)

Logic: Finds stocks where MULTIPLE strategies agree
- 4/4 agree = STRONG BUY (95% confidence, LOWEST RISK)
- 3/4 agree = STRONG BUY (85% confidence, LOW RISK)
- 2/4 agree = BUY (75% confidence, MEDIUM RISK)
```
