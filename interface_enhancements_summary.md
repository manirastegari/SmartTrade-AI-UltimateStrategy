# 🚀 Professional Trading App Interface Enhancements

## ✨ What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Timeframe Integration for Each Stock**
- **Smart Timeframe Detection**: Each analyzed stock now shows expected timeframes based on:

  - Fundamental strength (>70 score = long-term bias)
  - Signal types (RSI = 1-5 days, Golden Cross = 1-6 months)

- **Primary Timeframe Recommendation**: 
  - High confidence + strong fundamentals = Medium-term (1-4 weeks)
  - High confidence only = Short-term (1-14 days)  
  - Strong fundamentals only = Long-term (3-12 months)
  - Default = Medium-term swing trade
