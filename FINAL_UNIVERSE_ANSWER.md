## 📊 Your List vs My Optimized Universe

### Your 750-Stock List:
✅ **Good foundation** - Well-structured by market cap and sector  
✅ **TFSA-compatible** - All tradeable on Questrade  
✅ **Diversified** - Good sector coverage  

⚠️ **Issues found**:
- ~30 duplicate stocks (ANGO, ATRI, ICUI listed 2-3 times)
- Actual unique count: ~720 stocks
- Missing 2024-2025 winners (AI, quantum, hot growth)
- Limited Canadian exposure (only 15 TSX stocks)
- 1-2 delisted stocks (RIDE)

### My Optimized Universe:
✅ **779 unique stocks** (no duplicates)  
✅ **Better AI/Tech exposure** (+15 AI/quantum stocks)  
✅ **2x Canadian coverage** (39 TSX stocks vs your 15)  
✅ **All current winners** (SNOW, DDOG, CRWD, RIVN, SOFI)  
✅ **No delisted stocks** (cleaned and verified)
