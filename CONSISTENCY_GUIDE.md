# AI Trading App - Consistency & Coverage Guide

## âœ… Your Questions Answered

### 1. **Same Stocks Across Analysis Types**
**Q: How to make sure the app analyzes the same stocks for each analysis type?**

**A: âœ… SOLVED!** The app now uses **session-based stock selection caching**:

- When you first run an analysis, the app selects stocks based on your Cap Filter + Market Focus + Number of Stocks
- These **exact same stocks** are cached and reused for subsequent analyses
- You'll see: `ðŸ”„ Using same X stocks as previous analysis for consistency`
- Only **the scoring and ranking changes** based on Analysis Type, not the stock selection

### 2. **Guaranteed Same Stock Analysis**
**Q: If I choose small cap/medium/large and market focus, will the app review the same stocks?**

**A: âœ… YES!** The app guarantees consistency through:

- **Session State Caching**: Same parameters = same stocks
- **Parameter Tracking**: App tracks (Cap Filter, Market Focus, Stock Count)
- **Explicit Confirmation**: Shows "Using same X stocks as previous analysis"
- **Manual Control**: "ðŸ”„ Select New Stocks" button to change selection when needed

### 3. **Large Number Analysis**
**Q: How to ensure the app analyzes a large number of stocks for best options?**

**A: âœ… ENHANCED!** Multiple improvements:

- **Increased Default**: Now defaults to 100 stocks (was 50)
- **Minimum Coverage**: Enforces minimum 50 stocks even if you request fewer
- **Maximum Utilization**: Uses full universe capacity (348 unique stocks)
- **Smart Selection**: Market Focus prioritizes relevant stocks within cap filter
