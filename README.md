# SmartTrade AI - Ultimate Strategy 🏆

**Institutional-Grade Trading Intelligence System**

SmartTrade AI is a professional-grade trading terminal designed to replicate the decision-making processes of elite financial institutions. By combining **Consensus Investing**, **Advanced Machine Learning**, and **Macroeconomic Guardrails**, it identifies high-potential, low-risk opportunities across a premium universe of over 700+ stocks.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🌍 Phase 1: AI Global Market Scan
Powered by **xAI (Grok)**, the system analyzes the global environment before a single trade is considered:
*   **Regime Analysis:** Detects Risk-On/Risk-Off states.
*   **Sector Rotation:** Pinpoints institutional money flow.
*   **Macro Guardrails (NEW):** Integrated with **FRED (Federal Reserve Data)** to monitor the Yield Curve, Inflation (CPI), and Employment trends.

### 2. The Ultimate Strategy (5-Perspective Consensus)
Candidates must pass the scrutiny of five distinct investment philosophies:
*   **🏦 Institutional Grade:** Stability and consistent growth.
*   **🦈 Hedge Fund Alpha:** Momentum and relative strength.
*   **📊 Quant Value Hunter:** Fundamental valuation (Buffett style).
*   **🛡️ Risk-Managed Core:** Capital preservation and safety.
*   **💼 Investment Bank:** Analyst consensus and "Wall Street" approval.

**Consensus Tiers:**
*   **ULTIMATE BUY (5/5):** Passed all 5 strict criteria.
*   **STRONG BUY (4/5):** High conviction institutional pick.

### 3. 🧠 Phase 2: AI Validation & ML Meta-Predictor
*   **Grok-Enhanced Verification:** A second AI layer acts as a Portfolio Manager, checking news sentiment, catalysts, and system-wide risks.
*   **🤖 ML Meta-Predictor:** Ensembles 6 models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to predict outperformance probability.

### 4. 🛡️ Risk Management & Guardrails (NEW)
*   **Earnings Calendar Filter:** Automatically avoids trades near earnings announcements to prevent volatility spikes.
*   **Smart VIX Integration:** Robust VIX data flow from multiple sources (FRED, CNBC, Paid APIs) with neutral fallbacks for stability.
*   **Advanced Position Sizing:** Implements Volatility-Adjusted, ATR-Stop, and Kelly Criterion sizing models.
*   **TFSA/Questrade Optimization:** Fully aligned with TFSA-eligible symbols and Questrade-ready datasets.
